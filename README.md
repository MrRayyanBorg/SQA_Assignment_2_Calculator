Introduction
------------

This project is a calculator application that performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. It is built using a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient tool for performing basic mathematical calculations.

Workflow and Standards
----------------------

Our team follows Agile development methodology and we use GitHub Issues for our project management. We have a limited timeframe of 3 weeks to deliver this project, so we will be working in shorter development cycles, with a focus on delivering functional and tested features in a timely manner. We use GitHub for version control and project management, with GitHub Issues set up to track the progress of tasks and issues. Each team member is assigned specific roles and responsibilities, such as developer, tester, and project manager. We have daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and any blockers.

| Name      | Role |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Rayyan Borg      | Co-Project Manager & Developer       |
| Jesus Godinho    | Co-Project Manager & Tester            |

We adhere to industry standard coding practices and conventions. We use ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. Our team follows the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and we have a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. We use GitHub Actions for our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

We have a well-defined Definition of Done (DoD) and we ensure that all code is thoroughly reviewed before merging into the main branch. We use pull requests for code review and have a checklist in place to ensure all necessary checks are performed before merging. We also have a clear process in place for addressing and resolving conflicts.

We will be using GitHub Issues to manage our work and we will be working in shorter development cycles, with a focus on delivering functional and tested features in a timely manner, to ensure that we meet the deadline.

Coding Standards
----------------

Our team follows a set of coding standards to ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase. These standards include:

* **Naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes:** We use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for class names.
* **Indentation:** We use 2 spaces for indentation.
* **Comments:** We use inline comments to explain the purpose of a block of code or to provide additional information about a particular piece of code.
* **Git Commit messages:** We follow the convention of "verb + object" (e.g. "Fix bug in login page" or "Add tests for new feature").
* **File Structure:** We separate the code into different files and folders based on their functionality, this makes it easy to navigate and find the code that we need to work with.
* **Code Review:** Before merging any pull request, we will have at least one other team member review the code.

We also use tools like ESLint and Prettier to help enforce these coding standards, and we have a clear process in place for addressing and resolving any issues that may arise.
